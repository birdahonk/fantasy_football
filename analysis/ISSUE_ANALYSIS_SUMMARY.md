**🎯 Analysis Type**: Comprehensive Issue Review and Status Update

## 📋 IDENTIFIED ISSUES

### 🚨 **COMPREHENSIVE FREE AGENT REPORT ISSUES**

#### ❌ **Critical Data Missing**
1. **Yahoo Rankings showing "N/A"** - Yahoo free agents API doesn't include ranking data in standard response
2. **Tank01 Projections showing "N/A"** - Tank01 player matching issues for free agents
3. **News Headlines missing** - "No recent news available" for all players
4. **Sleeper Market Intelligence showing "Unknown"** - Player matching between Yahoo and Sleeper failing
5. **Column formatting issues** - Add counts getting truncated in tables
6. **DEF positions showing all N/A** - Defense-specific data handling needed

#### 🔧 **Root Causes**
- **Yahoo API Limitation**: Free agents endpoint doesn't include ranking/projection data
- **Player Name Matching**: Different APIs use different name formats (e.g., "Joe Flacco" vs "Joseph Flacco")
- **Defense Handling**: DEF positions need special logic as they represent team defenses, not individual players
- **API Response Structure**: Free agent responses have different structure than roster responses

### 🚨 **MATCHUP ANALYSIS REPORT ISSUES**

#### ❌ **Wrong Opponent**
1. **Using hypothetical opponent** instead of actual Week 1 opponent
2. **Missing opponent roster data** - Need actual opponent starting lineup
3. **Column width formatting** - Tables not properly aligned

#### 🔧 **Root Causes**
- **Yahoo Matchup API Complexity**: Matchup response structure is deeply nested and complex
- **Week Detection**: Need to properly parse current week and find corresponding opponent
- **Roster Parsing**: Same roster parsing issues affect opponent data retrieval
