## Outstanding Tasks

### Current Todo List (from TodoWrite tool)
- [x] **fix_multiposition_handling** - Fix ComprehensiveDataProcessor to handle multi-position players (WR,TE, RB,TE, etc.) by converting them to FLEX position
- [x] **fix_position_limits_mismatch** - Fix mismatch between data collection scripts and ComprehensiveDataProcessor position limits - scripts collect 235 players but processor only processes 120
- [x] **investigate_missing_enrichment** - Investigate why 10 out of 120 available players are missing Tank01 and Sleeper enrichment data
- [ ] **validate_token_usage** - Test and validate token usage to ensure it is within LLM limits for comprehensive analysis
- [ ] **enhance_analyst_agent** - Update analyst agent scripts and prompts to efficiently discover and utilize all compiled optimized player profile data, matchups, opponent information, season/week data, and NFL team schedules
- [ ] **test_full_ai_agent** - Test complete AI analyst agent evaluation and recommendations with comprehensive data integration

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Token Usage Validation** - Test token usage within LLM limits for comprehensive analysis
2. **Analyst Agent Enhancement** - Update analyst agent scripts and prompts for efficient data discovery
