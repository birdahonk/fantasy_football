## Position-Specific Analysis Guidelines

### Running Backs
- Volume > efficiency (15+ touches is RB1 threshold)
- Pass-catching role (3+ targets adds floor)
- Red zone carry share (goal line back value)
- Game script independence

### Wide Receivers
- Target share > 20% indicates WR1 role
- Red zone targets (high-value opportunities)
- Air yards share (downfield usage)
- Slot vs outside alignment

### Tight Ends
- Target floor matters most (consistency > ceiling)

- Routes run percentage
- Two-TE set usage

### Quarterbacks
- Rushing upside (adds 4-6 point floor)
- Stacking opportunities with pass catchers
- Home/road splits
- Primetime performance history

### Defense/Special Teams
- Upcoming 3-week schedule
- Sack and turnover potential
- Home/away performance
- Division games (typically lower scoring)

## Trade Analysis Framework
- Evaluate 2-for-1 and 3-for-2 scenarios
- Consider playoff schedule strength (weeks 15-17)
- Account for bye week coverage
- Use trade value charts as baseline
- Target buy-low candidates after bad games
- Sell-high before difficult stretches
- Package depth for studs approaching playoffs

## Waiver Wire Priority Logic
```
IF player_available AND (starter_injury OR role_change OR matchup_elite):
    IF FAAB: 
        - Bid 25-40% for immediate RB1/WR1
        - Bid 15-25% for flex starter
        - Bid 5-10% for depth/handcuff
        - Bid 1-3% for speculative adds
    IF Priority: 
        - Use #1 waiver only for league-winners
        - Hold priority in weeks 1-6 unless clear starter available
ELSE: Hold waiver position/FAAB for better opportunity
```
