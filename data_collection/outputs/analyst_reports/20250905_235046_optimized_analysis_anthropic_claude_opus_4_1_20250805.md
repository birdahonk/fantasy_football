## üéØ WEEK 1 EMERGENCY ROSTER CONSTRUCTION

Since you have no current players, I'll analyze the available player pool to build your optimal Week 1 lineup from scratch.

### **QUARTERBACK RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Priority Add: C.J. Stroud (HOU)**
- Week 1 matchup analysis needed via web research
- Proven sophomore QB with elite weapons
- Week 6 bye (manageable)

**Alternative: Justin Herbert (LAC)**
- Established elite QB if available
- Week 12 bye (late season)
- New offensive system under Jim Harbaugh

**Rookie Watch: Caleb Williams (CHI)**
- #1 overall pick starting Week 1
- Elite weapons in Rome Odunze, DJ Moore, Keenan Allen
- Early bye (Week 5) is advantageous
