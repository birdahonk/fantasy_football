  "analysis": "# \ud83d\udcca ROSTER HEALTH CHECK\n**Status**: \u26a0\ufe0f **Critical** - Unable to load roster data\n**Key Issues**: The roster data files appear to be empty or improperly formatted. I cannot see your current players, which prevents me from making specific recommendations.\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED\n\nTo provide you with accurate fantasy football advice, I need you to either:\n1. **Share your current roster** (list your players by position)\n2. **Re-run the data collection** to properly load your roster information\n3. **Manually input** your team details\n\n## \ud83d\udcf0 WEEK 1 CONTEXT & GENERAL GUIDANCE\n\nBased on the news data available:\n\n### Key Week 1 Developments:\n- **Eagles defeated Cowboys 24-20** in the season opener (weather-delayed game)\n- **Jalen Carter (Eagles DT)** was ejected before playing a snap - this impacts Eagles DST value\n- **Weather concerns** affected the kickoff game - monitor weather for all Week 1 outdoor games\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf GENERAL WEEK 1 START/SIT PRINCIPLES\n\nWithout seeing your specific roster, here are critical Week 1 guidelines:\n\n**MUST START** (if rostered):\n- All first-round picks (barring injury)\n- RBs with confirmed bellcow roles (15+ projected touches)\n- WRs who are clear WR1s on their teams\n- QBs in projected shootouts (45+ total)\n\n**STRONGLY CONSIDER SITTING**:\n- Rookies in their first NFL game\n- Players with new teams/systems\n- Anyone listed as questionable on Friday's injury report\n- Players facing elite defenses (SF, BAL, BUF)\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 WEEK 1 WAIVER WIRE TARGETS\n\nBased on typical Week 1 availability:\n\n### **Priority Adds** (if available):\n1. **Backup RBs** who may have won starting jobs in camp\n2. **WR3s on high-volume passing teams** (often underrostered)\n3. **Streaming DSTs** facing rookie QBs or poor offenses\n4. **Kickers** on high-scoring offenses\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 NEXT STEPS\n\n**What I Need From You:**\nPlease provide:\n1. Your current roster (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DST, Bench)\n2. League scoring settings (PPR, Half-PPR, or Standard)\n3. Any specific players you're considering adding/dropping\n\nOnce you share this information, I can provide:\n- Specific start/sit recommendations\n- Targeted add/drop moves with your free agent pool\n- Matchup-based analysis for Week 1\n- Strategic advice for your league format\n\n## \u2139\ufe0f SOURCES CONSULTED\n- NFL.com official news\n- CBS Sports NFL coverage  \n- Rotoworld player updates\n- Local data files (currently empty/unreadable)\n\n---\n\n**Please share your roster details so I can provide the specific, actionable advice you're looking for!**",
