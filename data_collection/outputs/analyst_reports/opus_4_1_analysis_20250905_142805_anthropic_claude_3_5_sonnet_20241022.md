## Analysis

I'll analyze your roster and available players for Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season, using only the provided data and current season context.

### üìä ROSTER HEALTH CHECK
**Status**: Concerns
**Key Issues**: 
- Christian McCaffrey questionable (calf) for Week 1 vs Seahawks
- Rookie Brian Thomas Jr. as WR1 is risky
- Potential committee concerns for bench RBs

### üéØ THIS WEEK'S LINEUP (Based on 2025 Data)

**MUST START:**
- QB: Joe Burrow
- RB1: Christian McCaffrey (monitor injury status)
- RB2: Nick Chubb
- WR1: Tee Higgins
- WR2: DK Metcalf (promote from bench)
- TE: Zach Ertz
- FLEX: Christian Kirk (over Jameson Williams)
- K: Matt Gay
- DST: Philadelphia (improved with Za'Darius Smith signing)

**BENCH:**
- Brian Thomas Jr. (rookie - wait and see approach)
- Jameson Williams (needs to prove consistency)
- Pat Freiermuth (backup TE)
- Omarion Hampton (depth RB)
- Tank Bigsby (depth RB)
- Isaac Guerendo (depth RB)

### üîÑ ADD/DROP MOVES

**Move #1** (Highest Priority)
- DROP: Isaac Guerendo
- ADD: Best available handcuff RB (please provide available players list for specific recommendation)
- Why: Guerendo is lowest upside RB, need McCaffrey insurance given injury concern

**Move #2** (If Possible)
- DROP: Tank Bigsby
- ADD: Best available WR (need available players list)
- Why: Need more proven WR depth with rookie Brian Thomas Jr. in starting role

**HOLD**: 
- Christian McCaffrey (despite injury concern)
- Brian Thomas Jr. (rookie upside)
- DK Metcalf (promote to starter)

### üìÖ NEXT WEEK PREVIEW
