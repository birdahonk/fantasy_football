## üìä ROSTER HEALTH CHECK
**Status**: Concerns  
**Key Issues**: CMC injury uncertainty, Nick Chubb coming off major injury, thin at startable RB depth

## üéØ THIS WEEK'S LINEUP

### MUST START:
- **QB**: Joe Burrow - Elite QB with Higgins back, great stack opportunity
- **RB1**: Christian McCaffrey - Start if active, but monitor injury status closely
- **RB2**: Tank Bigsby - Move to starter (over Chubb who may be limited Week 1)
- **WR1**: Tee Higgins - Elite WR2 with WR1 upside when healthy
- **WR2**: DK Metcalf - Move to starter (proven elite target share)
- **TE**: Pat Freiermuth - Start over Ertz (younger, more upside in new offense)
- **FLEX**: Brian Thomas Jr. - Rookie with clear WR1 role in JAX
- **K**: Matt Gay - Solid kicker on good offense
- **DST**: Philadelphia - Great defense, just dominated Cowboys

### BENCH:
- Nick Chubb - Coming off major injury, likely limited snaps Week 1
- Zach Ertz - Aging TE, keep as bye week fill
- Jameson Williams - Boom/bust, better options available
- Christian Kirk - WR2 in JAX behind Brian Thomas Jr.
- Isaac Guerendo - CMC handcuff, must hold
- Omarion Hampton - Rookie RB, wait and see

## üîÑ ADD/DROP MOVES

### **Move #1** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **DROP**: Omarion Hampton
- **ADD**: Jordan Mason (SF RB)
- **Why**: With CMC questionable, Mason is the direct backup and could be a league-winner if CMC misses time. Hampton is unproven rookie.

### **Move #2** (CRITICAL)
- **DROP**: Jameson Williams  
- **ADD**: Jaylen Warren (PIT RB)
- **Why**: Warren is a proven RB2 with standalone value and RB1 upside if Najee Harris gets hurt. Williams is your WR5 and too inconsistent.

### **Move #3** (IF POSSIBLE)
- **DROP**: Zach Ertz
- **ADD**: Tyler Allgeier (ATL RB) or Zach Charbonnet (SEA RB)
- **Why**: You have Freiermuth as TE1. Need RB depth desperately with Chubb/CMC concerns. Both are proven backups with standalone flex value.

### **HOLD**: 
- Isaac Guerendo (CMC handcuff - essential)
- Tank Bigsby (starting RB with upside)
- Christian Kirk (solid WR depth)

## üìÖ NEXT WEEK PREVIEW
- **Bye week problems**: None Week 1
- **Players to target**: Monitor CMC status - if he's out long-term, aggressively pursue RB help
- **Matchups to exploit**: Stream DST against weak offenses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

### Immediate Concerns:
1. **RB Depth Crisis**: You only have 2 healthy starting RBs if CMC is out
2. **Nick Chubb Risk**: Coming off major knee injury, may see limited snaps early
3. **No backup QB**: Consider adding one after Week 1

### Week 1 Specific Strategy:
- Start Tank Bigsby over Nick Chubb (Chubb likely on pitch count)
- Move DK Metcalf into starting lineup over Jameson Williams
- Consider Freiermuth over Ertz (better upside)
- Monitor CMC status up until kickoff

### Why These Moves Matter:
Your roster is top-heavy but lacks depth at RB. With CMC's injury history and Chubb coming off major surgery, you MUST prioritize RB depth immediately. The suggested adds (Mason, Warren, Allgeier/Charbonnet) are all proven NFL backs who will get touches Week 1, unlike your current bench RBs who are either injured or unproven rookies.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è SOURCES USED
- Yahoo Fantasy App roster data
- Current NFL news showing Eagles defeated Cowboys (your DST performed well)
- 2025 NFL season kickoff game results
- Standard fantasy football positional scarcity principles

**Action Required**: Make these moves ASAP before other managers grab these RBs. Your season depends on having startable RB depth given your current injury concerns.
