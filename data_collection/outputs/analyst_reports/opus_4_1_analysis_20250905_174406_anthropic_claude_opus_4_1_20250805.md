**Model:** anthropic - claude-opus-4-1-20250805
**Season Context:** Unknown - Week Unknown (Unknown)

## Analysis

# üìä ROSTER HEALTH CHECK
**Status**: Concerns  
**Key Issues**: 
- Nick Chubb (RB2) - Major concern as a starter coming off serious injury
- Christian McCaffrey (RB1) - Questionable with calf injury for Week 1
- Weak TE position with aging Zach Ertz as starter

## üéØ THIS WEEK'S LINEUP

**MUST START:**
- QB: Joe Burrow vs NE
- RB1: Christian McCaffrey vs SEA (monitor injury status)
- RB2: Tank Bigsby @ MIA (over Chubb)
- WR1: DK Metcalf @ SF
- WR2: Tee Higgins vs NE
- TE: Zach Ertz @ TB
- FLEX: Brian Thomas Jr. @ MIA
- K: Matt Gay @ TB
- DST: Philadelphia vs GB

**BENCH:**
- Nick Chubb (injury recovery concerns)
- Jameson Williams (wait and see approach)
- Christian Kirk (solid bench depth)
- Pat Freiermuth (backup TE)
- Omarion Hampton (stash)
- Isaac Guerendo (handcuff)

## üîÑ ADD/DROP MOVES

### **Move #1** (Highest Priority)
- **DROP**: Nick Chubb
- **ADD**: Rhamondre Stevenson (NE)
- **Why**: Stevenson is the clear lead back in New England with 15+ touch upside. Chubb's recovery timeline and role with Houston is uncertain for 2025.

### **Move #2** (Strong Recommendation)
- **DROP**: Omarion Hampton
- **ADD**: Rome Odunze (CHI)
- **Why**: Odunze is the #1 pick rookie WR with Caleb Williams. Hampton has minimal immediate value. Odunze could be a league-winner if he hits.

### **Move #3** (Optional Upside Play)
- **DROP**: Pat Freiermuth
- **ADD**: Evan Engram (DEN)
- **Why**: Engram moved to Denver and could see increased targets. Better upside than Freiermuth as your TE2.

**HOLD**: 
- Christian McCaffrey (elite when healthy)
- DK Metcalf (WR1 upside)
- Tank Bigsby (emerging role in JAX)

## üìÖ NEXT WEEK PREVIEW
- **Bye week problems**: None for Week 2
- **Players to target**: Monitor Khalil Shakir (BUF) if he's dropped - emerging slot role
- **Matchups to exploit**: Look for streaming DST options against weaker offenses

## üéØ CRITICAL NOTES ON 2025 CONTEXT

Based on the verified 2025 data:
- Nick Chubb is now with **Houston Texans** (not Cleveland)
- Christian Kirk is with **Houston Texans** (not Jacksonville)  
- Zach Ertz is with **Washington Commanders**
- Najee Harris is with **LA Chargers** (not Pittsburgh)
- Cooper Kupp is with **Seattle Seahawks** (not LA Rams)

Your roster has some concerning team changes from what might be expected. The Nick Chubb situation is particularly worrying as he's listed as your RB2 starter but his role in Houston is unclear after his injury.

**Immediate Action Required**: 
1. Monitor McCaffrey's injury status closely before Sunday
2. Execute the Chubb for Stevenson swap immediately - you need a reliable RB2
3. Consider grabbing Odunze as a high-upside stash

The available player pool shows strong options at WR (Odunze, Shakir, Josh Downs) and decent RB depth (Stevenson, Rachaad White). Your team needs immediate help at RB2 and could use WR depth for bye weeks ahead.
