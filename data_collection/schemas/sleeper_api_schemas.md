**Key Notes:**
- **Position Filtering**: Script applies position-based limits (default: QB:20, RB:20, WR:20, TE:20, K:20, DEF:10, FLEX:15)
- **Player Structure**: Each matched player contains both `yahoo_player` and `sleeper_player` data
- **Position Access**: Use `player['yahoo_player']['display_position']` for position filtering
- **Command Line Options**: Supports `--qb`, `--rb`, `--wr`, `--te`, `--k`, `--defense`, `--flex`, `--all`, `--dev` parameters

## API Details

- **Base URL**: `https://api.sleeper.app/v1/`
- **Authentication**: None required (completely free)
- **Rate Limits**: Reasonable usage (no strict limits documented)
- **Data Coverage**: 11,400+ NFL players with comprehensive metadata

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Correct Endpoint Names

**DO NOT USE THESE INCORRECT ENDPOINTS** (they will return 404 errors):
- ❌ `players/nfl/news` → ✅ News data comes from player objects (`news_updated` field)

**All Valid Endpoints:**
- ✅ `state/nfl` - NFL season state and current week
- ✅ `players/nfl` - Complete player database
- ✅ `players/nfl/trending/add` - Trending adds
- ✅ `players/nfl/trending/drop` - Trending drops  
- ✅ `players/nfl/trending/waiver` - Trending waivers

**News Data Access:**
- News information is embedded in player objects via the `news_updated` field
- No separate news endpoint exists
- Use `players/nfl` and extract `news_updated` timestamp for each player

## Data Enrichment Patterns

### Player Matching Algorithm:
```python
def match_player(yahoo_name, yahoo_team, sleeper_players):
    # 1. Exact name match
    # 2. Last name + team match  
    # 3. First + last initial match
    # 4. Sound-alike matching
    # Success rate: ~87% based on testing
```

### Cross-Reference Fields:
- **yahoo_id**: Direct Yahoo Fantasy player ID mapping
- **team**: NFL team abbreviation matching
- **position**: Position consistency validation
- **injury_status**: Real-time injury updates

## Team Defense Data

Team defense players in Sleeper have a special structure:

```json
{
  "player_id": "DEF_WSH",
  "first_name": "Washington",
  "last_name": "Commanders",
  "full_name": "Washington Commanders",
  "position": "DEF",
  "team": "WAS",
  "age": null,
  "birth_date": null,
  "years_exp": null,
  "height": null,
  "weight": null,
  "college": null,
  "status": "Active",
  "injury_status": null,
  "active": true,
  "sport": "nfl"
}
```

**Key Defense Player Fields**:
- **Name**: Full team name (e.g., "Washington Commanders", "Philadelphia Eagles")
- **Position**: Always "DEF"
- **Team**: Team abbreviation (e.g., "WAS", "PHI", "LAR")
- **Player ID**: Format "DEF_{TEAM_ABBR}" (e.g., "DEF_WSH", "DEF_PHI")
- **No Individual Stats**: Most individual player fields are null for defense

**Defense Player Identification Patterns**:
- **Sleeper Team Abbreviations**: Uses uppercase (e.g., "WAS", "PHI", "LAR", "CIN", "JAX")
- **Team Name Mapping**: Full team names in `full_name` field
- **Cross-API Matching**: Requires team abbreviation normalization for matching with Yahoo and Tank01
- **Special Handling**: Defense names converted to team names in ALL CAPS for display

---

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields:
- **player_id**: Must be present for all players
- **full_name**: Must be extractable for matching
- **position**: Must be valid NFL position
- **team**: Must be valid NFL team abbreviation (or null for free agents)

### Data Quality Checks:
- **Trending Data**: count > 0 for meaningful trends
- **Injury Data**: injury_status should be null or valid status
- **Depth Chart**: depth_chart_order should be numeric (1-99)
- **Cross-Platform IDs**: Should be numeric where present

### Enhancement Success Metrics:
- **Match Rate**: Target 85%+ player matching success
- **Injury Currency**: Sleeper injury data should be within 24 hours
- **Trending Relevance**: Focus on lookback_hours=24 for current trends

---

## Error Handling

### API Failures:
- Network timeouts (5-10 second timeout)
- JSON parsing errors (malformed responses)
- Rate limiting (though none currently enforced)

### Data Quality Issues:
- Missing player data (graceful degradation)
- Name matching failures (log for manual review)
- Team/position mismatches (flag for validation)

### Graceful Degradation:
- Continue processing if individual players fail
- Log match failures for improvement
- Provide partial data rather than complete failure

---

**Note**: The Sleeper API is exceptionally reliable and free. Use it extensively for player enhancement and market intelligence. The 87% matching rate with Yahoo players is excellent for this type of cross-platform integration.
