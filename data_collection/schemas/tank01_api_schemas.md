## Critical Findings for Data Completeness

### 1. Missing Data Sources

**Current Issues**:
- **Injury Status**: Not available in current endpoints
- **Fantasy Outlook**: Not available in current endpoints
- **Player-Specific News**: News endpoint provides general fantasy news, not player-specific

**Solutions**:
- Use `getNFLGamesForPlayer` to get recent game data and infer injury status
- Use `getNFLTeams` top performers to get fantasy outlook context
- Consider using game-specific data to provide more relevant news context

### 2. Enhanced Data Extraction Strategy

**For My Roster Script**:
1. **Add Player Game Stats**: Use `getNFLGamesForPlayer` for each player to get:
   - Recent game performance
   - Snap count percentages
   - Injury indicators (low snap counts, missed games)
   - Historical performance trends

2. **Add Depth Chart Context**: Use `getNFLDepthCharts` to get:
   - Player's depth chart position
   - Competition for playing time
   - Role clarity and opportunity

3. **Add Team Context**: Use `getNFLTeams` to get:
   - Team performance and trends
   - Top performers context
   - Team statistics that affect player value

**For Available Players Script**:
1. **Batch Processing**: Use team-based approaches to minimize API calls
2. **Depth Chart Integration**: Include depth chart positions for all players
3. **Team Performance Context**: Add team-level data for better analysis

### 3. API Usage Optimization

**Current Efficiency**: 6 calls for 15 players (0.4 calls per player)
**Target Efficiency**: 8-10 calls for 200+ players (0.04-0.05 calls per player)

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Batch Team Data**: Get team rosters and depth charts once per team
2. **Selective Player Stats**: Only get game stats for key players
3. **Caching**: Cache team and depth chart data between runs
4. **Smart Filtering**: Focus on players with recent activity

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error structures:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "body": "Error message"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

- **Current Plan**: 1000 calls/day
- **Usage Tracking**: Built into all API calls
- **Optimization**: Batch calls where possible to minimize usage
- **Monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking and warnings

## Implementation Notes

- All string values in responses are returned as strings, not numbers
- Team abbreviations may vary between endpoints
- Player matching requires multiple strategies due to name/team variations
- News endpoint provides general fantasy news, not player-specific news
- Game stats provide the most comprehensive individual player data
- Depth charts provide crucial context for player opportunities
- Team data provides important context for player value assessment
